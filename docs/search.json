    "text": "Only a few game franchises hold a special place in my heart; one of which is Call of Duty. There are a couple reasons for this, but I feel that the most significant reason is timing (or luck). Subjectively speaking, being between the ages of seven (maybe six) and fourteen during the ‘modern gaming explosion’ of the early-mid 2000s is something I have a hard time putting into words. Any younger and the experience might not be fully grasped, or, maybe the lack of early freedom (e.g., sleepovers, asking for consoles at Christmas, etc.) kids who were slightly older had, played a role in limiting exposure. Any older and I’d argue that other aspects of life start reducing that freedom (e.g., high school, jobs, socialising); some of which also start removing that naivety which, in my opinion, was crucial during that initial exposure. Ultimately, being in the ‘goldilocks zone’ during this time was special."

    "text": "2010s\nFor almost a decade playing Call of Duty during its release was the highlight of the year for my friends and I. We would play online competitively, discuss gameplay elements in school and have nights where we would be in the same room until the sun came up. However, something changed around 2013 and it has taken me some time to understand why. Firstly, as mentioned above, the freedom and naivety (which used to be full) started to disappear. Secondly, on a more neurological level, an annual habit loop established and with each yearly release the dopamine response gradually declined; the game slowly became more recycled and therefore, less fun. Thirdly, the industry as a whole started to change. I could be wrong, but sometime around the release of Advanced Warfare, a whole new can of worms (i.e., microtransactions) opened for Activision Blizzard – the franchise’s publisher. A major paradigm shift had occurred and from that point onward, predatory game decisions seemingly inundated every new release pushing gameplay and creativity to the side.¹ Despite these points, we did find ourselves recharged for a few titles during the mid 2010s; namely, Black Ops III in 2015. However, about a third of the way through that cycle, I noticed the end of my time with the series approaching for one reason in particular. I had begun to create obscure challenges for myself within the game in order to make the game fun. The last part of that sentence was a tough realisation for me. I was playing the game because I had always played it, not because I still enjoyed the base experience it offered. This continued for a number of years (i.e., played sparingly from 2015 onward) until I was presented with the opportunity to happily close the Call of Duty chapter earlier this year."

    "text": "2020s\nDuring my time in Sault Ste. Marie, I lived with (and met) some folks who were primarily Zombies players and played fairly regularly. By this point, I had not played Call of Duty since the start of the pandemic and had no desire to play because the current release looked like a carbon copy of 2012. But, there were some down nights and I ended up picking the controller back up every now and then. Because it was late in the annual cycle, some fan favourite maps had been added and, almost immediately, I defaulted back to something I started doing in Black Ops III: throwing tomahawks across the map in Search and Destroy (i.e., creating an obscure challenge).² For me, there is no greater humiliation in the series than spawning in, running for a few seconds, instantly dying by a tomahawk and having to watch the kill cam and the remainder of the round go on from the sideline. Conversely, as the tomahawk thrower, there is unbelievable satisfaction in connecting with a tomahawk, specifically a cross-map one, because the chances are incredibly low and the humiliation on the other end is so high. So it began - I casually threw tomahawks out of nostalgia, until I hit a few; then I hit a few more. I started saving the clips to show the roommates and all of a sudden the idea of ‘how feasible is it to get one on every map’ was thrown around. I thought it was next to impossible based on a few of the map layouts, but another thought entered my brain shortly after: I had always admired the Youtube montages and editing skills of some of the Call of Duty content creators – ‘why not create something? You have always wanted to.’ Admittedly, when I was younger, I desperately wanted to make some sort of film or clan montage for us Cloverdale guys, but I always ended up quitting; editing was too hard, so much time was needed. On and on went the list of excuses and I never did complete anything substantial. Shortly after some back and forth the challenge was born and I got obsessed with completing it. Ultimately, after thousands of tomahawk throws, I did in fact complete the absurd challenge of hitting a cross-map tomahawk on every map.³ Then, after quickly learning Adobe After Effects and what seemed like hundreds of hours later, I finished the video; most importantly, for myself, but also for the roommates and friends of ‘TheJankHouse’. It truly feels like the perfect ending chapter. Now, I can rest easy knowing I have accomplished everything I have ever wanted to within the Call of Duty universe. This was likely my last time ever playing the franchise and I am glad to say I left on my highest note.\nFor now,\nMGW\n\n\n¹ Later, releases like Fortnite would exacerbate this.\n² A popular one life attack and defend game mode based off of Counter-Strike.\n³ Every map released until the end of August was completed; I moved away after that and could not continue."

    "text": "During Modern Warfare II (MWII), I spent the majority of my time in Search and Destroy attempting to hit cross-map throwing knives. After I hit Embassy, the last 6v6 map I needed, I had amassed 91 cross-maps in total. After omitting Shipment, I tried to pull out a few interesting details to share with the community. This dataset will also be available on GitHub if anyone wants to use it in the future. Some quick facts off the top:\n\nI played a total of 562 games of Search and Destroy.\nThe number of matches on each map ranged from 4-62 with Vondel and Embassy being the lowest and highest, respectively.\nThe most challenging map was Embassy as I only recorded one cross-map in 62 games.\nThe map with the highest amount of cross-maps (15) was Zarqwa Hydroelectric."

    "text": "Analysis\nI had a general sense of which maps I hit the most and which ones proved difficult as I progressed, but getting a bird’s eye view of the data illuminates several interesting details (Figure 1). For instance, more than half the maps (n = 14) were only hit once or twice. I’ve attributed this to several factors:\n\nMap difficulty — both spawns on several maps (e.g., Strike, Museum) are incredibly challenging and require some creativity and lots of luck.\nCompletionist — after going dry for many months on some of these maps, I just took a single kill and moved on.\nSeasonal releases — some maps (e.g., La Casa) are released much later and naturally get less reps than the base maps. This can also compound with #1, #2, or both (e.g., Himmelmatt).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Cross-map throwing knife kills on each map in MWII Search and Destroy.\n\n\n\n\nAnother interesting observation was that five maps — Hydroelectric, Farm, Taraq, Raceway, and Dome — were responsible for 54% of my kills. Thinking back to the aforementioned factors, it is clear that Farm and Dome have relatively low degrees of difficulty as: 1) throwing knives are viable from both spawns; 2) distances are short; and 3) strong arm can be used to shoot gaps at low angles giving enemies less time to react. Conversely, the other three maps are more intriguing, largely because there may be a tendency to favour one spawn over the other (Figure 1). Let’s begin examining why it might be easier to hit cross-maps from the offense side of Raceway, and the defensive side of Taraq and Hydroelectric."

    "section": "Case studies",
    "text": "Case studies\n\n1. Crown Raceway — the most obvious example\nCrown Raceway has a relatively large discrepancy in spawn safety, with defense holding the distinct advantage. The left side of the tall, central building naturally protects players until they want to run up the stairs to mid-street — the most logical area for hitting cross-maps from offense (Figure 2). I hit several here which I’d consider fairly lucky. It is a relatively high traffic area; however, the variability in the throw combined with a) having to clear the concrete barrier; b) hitting a narrow kill zone; and c) underutilisation of the upper platform, which knives tend to bounce up on, make this more challenging than it looks (Figure 3). Note that hitting AFK players directly at spawn is also possible, but I’d argue it requires more luck.\n\n\n\nFigure 2. An overview of the defense spawn and the route players must take to be vulnerable to this particular cross-map.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. The kill zone and knife path for the cross-map from the offense spawn.\n\n\nLet’s take a look at the other side. At first glance, the offense spawn looks quite safe; however, upon further inspection, I believe it is actually one of the more dangerous spawns in the game. The bomb entices players to run middle, which has a long runway and no barriers (Figure 4). This combined with a relatively consistent sprint-throw from the other side — that almost always clears the back end of the central building — is a recipe for disaster. A wide kill zone, which reduces the need for precision and timing, bouncing, and players running near-parallel to the knife path leaves everyone exposed, even those who are AFK.\nConclusion: my data suggests that the offense cross-map is easier; however, I’d argue that defense has the better setup.\n\n\n\nFigure 4. An overview of the cross-map thrown from the defense spawn.\n\n\n\n\n2. Taraq — an interesting case of design\nTaraq being in my top five maps was somewhat surprising given its large size and asymmetric layout. Let’s start with the throws from offense because Infinity Ward did not give us any favours here. The large blue building in front of the defensive spawn forces players left towards B, which is more open, or right through a small corridor towards A (Figure 5). Unfortunately, the strategic position of the large central tower makes hitting the B route a near-impossible task (one I never attempted). That leaves trying to perfect the A throw — a sprint-jump toss into a vague grey sky that has to a) get over the balcony; or b) be left of the balcony and miss the pillar, which makes aim and timing absolutely crucial (Figure 6). Given these factors, I’d chalk the three I hit from this spawn up to luck, mostly. They are easily some of my favourite kills since so much has to go right (where is theatre mode when you need it).\n\n\n\nFigure 5. The central tower and blue platform and adjoined retaining wall protect players exiting spawn towards B.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6. The A corridor and the window a throwing knife needs to go through to be successful. Note that aiming towards the exit (i.e., further left from the throwing perspective) is also viable.\n\n\nAlthough the defensive throw is pretty blind (due to blue), the offense spawn is more forgiving and does us a subtle, but key favour. The characters tend to spawn in looking more left (towards A), which perhaps leads to more A rushes; it may also have no effect on player decision-making (Figure 7). Regardless, the path to A is really the only viable cross-map option (as the B rush is well guarded) — lucky us. The area in front of spawn is quite open and the perpendicular runway offers lots of lead time if you can fly the retaining wall and avoid the corner building on the right (Figure 8). AFK players are also in play and a consistent point and release throw with strong arm makes this easier than expected.\nConclusion: I’ll take my chances with the defensive throw over a rare — albeit sublime — offense kill everytime.\n\n\n\nFigure 7. View of a typical player spawn and the large kill zone on offense.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8. Opposite viewpoint of the offense spawn that better illustrates the wide throwing angle. How little cover there is available for players if they choose to run towards A bomb is also evident.\n\n\n\n\n3. Zarqwa Hydroelectric — the most dangerous spawn in the game?\nZarqwa Hydroelectric is simply a cross-mapping paradise; however, there are some key factors as to why kills on offense seem to be harder to come by than its counterpart. Looking at the offense knife kill zone, the long runway to mid is relatively good from a cross-map perspective, but the players are protected by the generator building and its electric towers and are actually at a slightly lower elevation due to the carved out path on the right (Figure 9). Moreover, situated right in front of this path are various liquid containers and a power pole, which may play a sneaky role in reducing success. I figure a few lives were saved due to deflections/bounces off of these surfaces. Ultimately, knives have to cross the map, clear the building, and get down fast which allows many players to be safe by that time (if they’re quick off the draw at round start).\n\n\n\nFigure 9. The area of interest for the cross-map thrown from offense.\n\n\nConversely, tossing knives from defense is a dream setup (Figure 10). Player spawns in the kill zone? Check. Point and release strong arm throw? Check. Long, straight runway with no barriers and bounce opportunities? Check. Perfect bomb placement that entices players to funnel down the middle lane? Check. After a while, I expected to hit one from this side every game — it is the textbook example of what to look for when cross-mapping. Although this is a small sample size, offense on Zarqwa Hydroelectric may very well be the most dangerous Search and Destroy spawn in the game.\nConclusion: defense everytime.\n\n\n\nFigure 10. The nightmare scenario for players spawning and subsequently running middle on offense."

Looking at Figure 11, it’s pretty evident that my cross-maps occurred at three distinct times:\n\nRelease — excited to play the game and find spots on new maps, etc.\nMarch to April 2023 — likely returned to check out a new season and was clearly consumed with knocking out cross-maps.\nAround the release of the next Call of Duty — had to grind out the remaining maps before I moved on to the next game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11. Daily cross-map kills during the Modern Warfare II game cycle. Years are indicated by blue dotted lines.\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, my data follows the ‘typical’ Call of Duty player cycle pretty well, which makes me laugh — I guess it is a thing after all.
